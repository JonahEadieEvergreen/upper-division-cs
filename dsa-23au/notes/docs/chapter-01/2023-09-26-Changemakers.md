- The key to running an effective and socially beneficial business is to
  promote an inclusive, creative environment in the workplace which allows
  everyone's vision for the future of the company to impact overall strategy
- Complex system emerge out of the chaos of nature through self-organization.
  The Changemakers lab is designed to foster this sort of horizontal self-
  organization rather than a top-down teacher-student hierarchy
- When working in a team in DSA, it's important to value each person's input
  and offer everyone an oppurtunity to contribute to the project according
  to their vision for it
